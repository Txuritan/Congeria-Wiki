                                <h1>Welcome to the TKI 101 Wiki!</h1>
								<p> So you want to know what TKI 101 is exactly? It is a universe, one that beholds a whole setting of worlds in which evey single character in this series came from. TKI 101 is also calld Tekaria or just simply TKI and it was created by the Three Guardians ages ago. The Three Guardians, such as Nai, Ynnek and Relyt envisioned an created their very own worlds known to be many but here are some of the worlds such as Dragoah, Earthora, Saintaints, Cat World, Oceania, Kentotia, Caneria and Lavarkee and Neko World. The whole point of this seies is that its a fantasy universe that progresses through time (Since almost every fantasy novel or thing is always focus on a medieval like setting) but in TKI you will see the races of dragons, elves, humans and beast progess in worlds that will lead then to an Industrial Revolution to the Modern Age and into the Future!
