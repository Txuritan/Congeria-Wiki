[Eden Crystal](/characters-eden-crystal.html) who was born in Kalcif [Kalcif](places-kalcif.html) [Dragorah](planets-dragorah.html) who was son of Emperor [Xileo Crystal](characters-xileo-crystal.html) who like the ideology of Dragoran superiority and wanted to expand the Dragoran Empire, invading human and elven kingdoms across the planet. When Eden was a teen, he was very skilled and educated in both martial arts and he was also a priest at one point. He was also very skilled in sorcery and physics that made him very strong and flexible, since he was part dragon he had the instinct of a dragon and which was what made him get angry easily at most points, he would eather spit fire and burn down an entire village (On accident) or he would purposely throw large structures at people such as bolders, building peices or even othe people. Once Eden was fully grown he wanted to become emperor, but his father didn't want him to because of his dragon like attitude. Eden, however didn't like that and one day he stormed into the palace and overthrew his father's throne. Half of the city was destroyed, including the palace itself. Eden faught his father in a one-two-one battle and eventually Eden killed his father. [Xileo](characters-xileo-crystal.html) look at [Eden](characters-eden-crystal.html) and said "Go ahead -emperor." Becuase [Xileo](characters-xileo-crystal.html) knew he was dying and that his son had already token over the empire, he named his son and nemesis "Emperor." Eden was the new emperor of [Dragorah](planets-dragorah.html) and many of the people thier loved him. Eden changed most of the empires government and made it into a ministry which for the next few thousand years would change Dragorah's history forever. The first few hundred years was a golden age for Dragorah but Eden's soul grew darker as a dark sickness of greed an power controlled his mind. Eden however banned the worship of the Three Guardians and replace it into [Blank] which changed Dragoran belief. The portals that were created by the Three Guardians were harnessed by Eden's powers and discovered other worlds such as [Earthora](planets-earthora.html), [Oceania](planets-oceania.html), and [Lavarkee](planets-lavarkee.html) which Eden sought immediantly to expand the Dragoran Empire onto these other worlds. However the people of the other worlds did not like the Dragorans and they all rebelled against them, Oceania however remained a Dragoran ruled world. Edem evemtually wnated to do something he always wanted to do, and that was to bring back the dragons that had died ages ago. This was a time of war as Dragorah started invading the other worlds. This war was known as the [War of the Dragons](wars-war-of-the-dragons.html) which would eventually lead to the ending days of Eden himself. As the war continued mostly with Earthora, a elven prince named [Kronos](characters-kronos.html) who was chosen by the Three Guardians to stop Eden. Eden was the most powerful man in the void, he was considered Overlord of the void and eventually his plan was to become a god and he would try and to destroy the Three Guardians. However, Kronos defeated Eden in the Battle of the Finnest Hour and Eden was bannish from existence. Kronos became a hero to many people, he was even considered a god but in reality he was only a prince and he became the first emperor of Earthora. As people believed Eden was gone forever, and Dragorah was weakened and its empire fell apart several times as it broke into several kingdoms, Eden was frozen in space and time inside one of the portals and that remained for the next 1,400 years.
