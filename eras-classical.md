The classical era was a time of some of the most biggest events in history that took place from Lucius deafeting Alpha to Eden becoming emperor and overlord and eventually being defeated by Kronos. It is hard to estimate when the era began, the earliest it started was around 1,435 BDE when Alphalord took his final attempt on invading a Feline kingdom and eventually was defeated by Lucius who eventually became one of greatest heros in histroy (The Protector and Keeper of the Blue Diamond) Lucius lived on to change and help shape Cat World's future. Meanwhile in Dragorah, the most powerful empire was falling apart by the rule of Xileo Crystal who became emperor and tried destroying his own planet. Luckily his son Eden Crtstal (His son) killed hsi father and took his throne. The Dragorans look upon Eden as a "hero" and by the next thousand years Eden was a great and fair ruler but over the years he became sick and wicked by his powers that made him so great and he wanted to become an Overlord (a type of god)
