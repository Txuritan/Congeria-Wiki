The classical era was a time of some of the most biggest events in history that took place from Lucius deafeting Alpha to Eden becoming emperor and overlord and eventually being defeated by Kronos. It is hard to estimate when the era began, the earliest it started was around 1,435 BDE when Alphalord took his final attempt on invading a Feline kingdom and eventually was defeated by Lucius who eventually became one of greatest heros in histroy (The Protector and Keeper of the Blue Diamond) Lucius lived on to change and help shape Cat World's future. Meanwhile in Dragorah, the most powerful empire was falling apart by the rule of Xileo Crystal who became emperor and tried destroying his own planet. Luckily his son Eden Crystal (His son) killed hsi father and took his throne. The Dragorans look upon Eden as a "hero" and by the next thousand years Eden was a great and fair ruler but over the years he became sick and wicked by his powers that made him so great and he wanted to become an Overlord (a type of god) who would take contol of the entire void. However the Three Guardians didn't like this and sought evil in Eden's soul and decided that they were gonna have to stop him. Eden used his powers and summoned an army of dead dragons and started invading other worlds such as Earthora, Saintaints and Oceania. The other worlds immediately took action and the start of the Great War of the Dragons began. As Eden bashed against each world there was no hope for anyone what so ever, but a elven prince named Kronos who lived in Earthora, stood up against Eden and used the "Guardian's Wrath" that literally bannished Eden out of the void. Kronos was look upon as a very great hero to eveyone and established the Earthoran Empie. Kronos became emperor and the ages changed from BDE to ADE (meaning after the defeat of Eden) which for the next few hundred years lived a time of peace and posperity. However over the years the event of Kronos and Eden became a legend and the Dark Ages began as Dragoran Empire started to rise again.
