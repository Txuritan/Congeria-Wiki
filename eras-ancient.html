The ancient era was a time from the point that magic was first used and discovered to the rise of many great empires in the worlds of Dragorah, Earthora, Saintaints, Oceania and Cat World. The oldest world to develop a civilization first was most likely Dragorah, which was originally home to the Dragon Gods thousands of years before the Dragorans (a race mix between human and dragon) creaated the Dragoran Empire. Between 183,983 - 65,833 BDE (BDE also means before the defeat of Eden) was the time the Dragon Gods lived, they were servants of the Three Guardians but eventually they wanted to control things on their own which the came to a point in time known as the Primeval Dragon War which lasted roughly between 31,432 - 30,679 BDE. It was a chaotic war and one of the if not the first war ever recorded in living history. The Three Guardians manage to use their forces of nature and killed off and annihilated the entire dragon race to the point only very few survived, and those ones became mortal and beastly. However the cycle of gods lived on on the planet Oceania, where they lived peacefuly and as the form of baskilisk around 7,253 BDE. Around this time many of the lesser races of elves, humans and beast began to develop their civilizations rising over the ruins the dragon gods. The Dragorans who they were a mix race between human and dragon were one of the earliest of the mortals that became an advance race. The Dragorans invaded and conquered a elven kingdom in the harsh volcanic tundra that would eventually become Dragorah. The Dragorans established the first empire in the void and became one of the most powerful ones too. Around 3,253 BDE the elves of Saintaints had form their first empire known as the First Brenthren Dynasty while in Cat World around 2,543 BDE the first Feline empire was founded under the Goddess Starlight (a goddess in the form of a cat) Caneria, the world home to the Canines, was a cold and dark world, but their god "Alpha" discovered the NYR Portal System and controlled a portal to get to Cat World. The Canines invaded Cat World and Alpha seak demand to take over it, however Satrlight faught him off and to protect the felines only leading to her death and her son Lucius was taken to the Protectors Temple where he would be safe. However Alpha and the Canines took over Cat World and most of the Felines were killed or taken as slaves by the canines.
