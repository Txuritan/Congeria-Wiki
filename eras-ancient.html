The ancient era was a time from the point that magic was first used and discovered to the rise of many great empires in the worlds of Dragorah, Earthora, Saintaints, Oceania and Cat World. The oldest world to develop a civilization first was most likely Dragorah, which was originally home to the Dragon Gods thousands of years before the Dragorans (a race mix between human and dragon) creaated the Dragoran Empire. Between 183,983 - 65,833 BDE (BDE also means before the defeat of Eden) was the time the Dragon Gods lived, they were servants of the Three Guardians but eventually they wanted to control things on their own which the came to a point in time known as the Primeval Dragon War which lasted roughly between 31,432 - 30,679 BDE. It was a chaotic war and one of the if not the first war ever recorded in living history. The Three Guardians manage to use their forces of nature and killed off and annihilated the entire dragon race to the point only very few survived, and those ones became mortal and beastly.
